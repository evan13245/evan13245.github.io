    	<p> Another one of my favorite things to do is to take trips to Florida with my family. My dad's brother lives in Florida so we love going to visit our family and doing different things with them like going to Orlando or the Florida keys. Since we don't get to see them much, it's really a fun experience for me and the rest of my family.
