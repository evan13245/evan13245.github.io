	<H1> Mexico </H1>
<p> The trip of a lifetime that I will never forget was my trip to Mexico with my dad. We went swimming with the dolphins and explored the many different wonders that Mexico had to offer. We went on a couple of different excursions and took a boat to an island where we went golf carting and explored the many shops on the island. </p>
