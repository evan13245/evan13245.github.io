    	<H1> Day Trips </H1>
    	<p> One of my favorite things to do is to take trips with my friends. With Maine being far away from home, my favorite thing to do with my friends is take trips to Bar Harbor and Acadia and explore the many different things Maine has to offer. My friends and I like to hike in Acadia and explore the different shops in Bar Harbor.
    	<p> Back home in New Jersey, my favorite thing to do is go to the Jersey shore with my friends and also go to the city. One of my favorite things to do in the city is to go out for dinner and go to Rangers ice hockey games with my friends.
